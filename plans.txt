PLANS

Endless-JRPG
Fight your way through until you lose.
Stats and math will roughly be based on my TTRPG math plans.

GENERAL IDEAS
You have 4 characters that each have a role
(Roles may be selected at game start)
Every 4 fights they live through, your characters gain a level
(improve the character selected.)
Each role has X abilities and gains a fixed stat array per level.
A level up may be traded for an equipment roll
(the item will be on-level for your party, and roughly biased towards the character it's rolling for, but the slot and stats or any special abilities will be random.)

NEWGAME
Pick your character's roles, and possible sprite set
(I have to draw at least 4 characters, and can expand on more. Maybe these will become meta-sprite sets for simplicity.)
(i also need to get a drawing template to edit on to make this faster.)
Possibly see the best records for previous runs for roles or info preview
Name characters as well.

Roles
There are X roles in the game.
Each role should have some flavor/fluff attached (ex: preferred weapon names, core stats per level)
And X abilities (4? 8?) that can be used instead of a straight attack
(roles should have a set of abilities based towards their purpose, but can branch out)
EX: White Mage might have Heal, Resurrect, UnPoison, and TurnUndead
starting stats and stat gain is determined by role.

Fight
The core game screen.

Improve
When a character lives through 4 fights, the improve screen opens up for them (multiple levels queue the screen up multiple times)
You can choose to gain extra stat points OR boost up an ability
