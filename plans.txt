PLANS

Endless-JRPG
Fight your way through until you lose.
Stats and math will roughly be based on my TTRPG math plans.

GENERAL IDEAS
You have 4 characters that each have a role
(Roles may be selected at game start)
Every 4 fights they live through, your characters gain a level
(improve the character selected.)
Each role has X abilities and gains a fixed stat array per level.
A level up may be traded for an equipment roll
(the item will be on-level for your party, and roughly biased towards the character it's rolling for, but the slot and stats or any special abilities will be random.)
Every X fights (12? 20?) is a boss fight
Boss fights are a separate encounter list (or a fixed list for a plot?) with significantly higher stats.

GRAPHICS
i think I want 5 colors per sprite? (4 + transparent) to do the Bloodstained-style NES+ graphics? Or closer to 16 for the SNES?
Stick to the PV8 Palette? Or expand it?
THeme: cyberpunk? urban fantasy? plain sci-fi? Eclipse Phase (octopus pc!)?
frames: 7-11 total?
1 Idle
2-4 attack
2-4 use ability
1 dead
1 on-recieve-hit

NEWGAME
Pick your character's roles, and possible sprite set
(I have to draw at least 4 characters, and can expand on more. Maybe these will become meta-sprite sets for simplicity. I also might stick roles and sprites together.)
(i also need to get a drawing template to edit on to make this faster.)
Possibly see the best records for previous runs for roles or info preview
Name characters as well.

Roles
There are X roles in the game.
Each role should have some flavor/fluff attached (ex: preferred weapon names, core stats per level)
And X abilities (4? 8?) that can be used instead of a straight attack
(roles should have a set of abilities based towards their purpose, but can branch out)
EX: White Mage might have Heal, Resurrect, UnPoison, and TurnUndead
starting stats and stat gain is determined by role.

Fight
The core game screen.
Very FF1-6 style fight screen, PCs on right, monsters on left.
Simple stat system from existing docs. tweaking may occur in practice.
Enemies have base stats per level, actual fights are randomized (may have fixed fights for a plot progression deal eventually)

Improve
When a character lives through 4 fights, the improve screen opens up for them (multiple levels queue the screen up multiple times)
You can choose to gain extra stat points, boost up an ability of theirs, or roll for an equipment drop. (equipment will offer good stat boosts, but slot and distribution is random)

UNLOCKS
Make sufficient progress and you can unlock new options
EX: get White Mage and Fighter to a certain level each, unlock a Monk that has a combo of both melee and healing powers.
These could be roles or sprite options, possibly equipment power. Maybe other things for progressing faster (like keeping an item between games or starting at a higher level?)

DEVELOPMENT PLANS
use metasprites where possible
write up core system pieces - 1 to make sure stuff compiles
Get baseline fight scene in place
get baseline improve scene in place.
do spritework for baseline char and enemy
prove system runs.
Add baseline content ()
implement additional content into systems (enemies, characters, roles, etc)
